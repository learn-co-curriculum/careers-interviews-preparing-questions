# Preparing Questions for Interviews

Toward the end of almost every interview, you will likely be asked “What questions do you have for me [the interviewer]?” 

Many job seekers make the mistake of not preparing interview questions, which makes them look unprepared and uninterested. Don’t make this mistake.

Think about why we ask questions. Preparing questions is part of participating in a successful interview process, and ultimately getting a job offer but don’t ask questions for the sake of it. Think about asking a question whose answer will provide insights that provide for meaningful discussion and that drive a conversation forward. 

## What to Prepare

You want to be ready with 3-5 questions before going into every interview and networking coffee to demonstrate that you've done thorough research and are a passionate person who takes the process seriously. If you’re interviewing with multiple people, prepare customized questions for each person. 

You may have had questions prepared that over the course of the interview get answered. However, in no case should you ever respond to the question “What questions do you have for me [the interviewer]?” with “You’ve answered all my questions!” If you’re actively listening throughout the interview, you should be formulating additional questions as the interview progresses. 

## How to Approach Preparing Questions

Start by doing your research (we have a detailed lesson on this that you’ve already finished by this point). You will focus on three types of research: **the company, the people, and the job**. As you conduct your research, it should be easy to formulate questions for your interviewer. 

While you’re pouring over the **company’s** website, blog, and linkedIn page, jot down notes about what stands out to you, or what you’re curious to learn more about. Below are examples of what to think about: 

- Goals the company has for its employees and the organization
- Problems the company is solving
- Future plans the company has for growth or new products 
- The company’s mission/values and how they align with your own

While you’re furiously reading the LinkedIn profiles of the **people** on the hiring team at the company, thinking about the things below can lead to great questions and, in turn, great conversation:

- Technologies the team uses
- Organizational structure
- Existing team’s strengths, backgrounds

As you review the **job** description line by line, what are you wondering about the [insert example job description bullet here]. 

- The company's technical challenges
- Technologies their team uses
- Cross-functional roles and communicating with other teams
- Opportunities to work on side projects and contribute to open source project

If you do thorough research, are a curious person (which you are) and have a genuine interest in the company, you should be able to prepare questions. Additionally, if you’re actively listening throughout the interview, you should be able to come up with even more questions!

## Make Weak Questions Stronger

Don’t ask a vague question like “What is your company culture?". This question is weak and wastes your interviewer’s time, because you can easily find that answer on the company’s website or blog. However, you can ask a question about a company’s culture that demonstrates you did research, and turn that weak question into a strong one. See an example below: 

>“I read on your blog that [Company name] emphasizes an open culture where employees are encouraged to contribute to open source projects. Can you elaborate on that and what it means for your team?”

## When Do You Ask Questions? 

Remember that you don’t have to reserve all of your questions for the end or wait until you’re prompted to ask your questions. If a topic comes up about which you were planning to ask a question, and it would be natural for you to ask it mid-interview, do that. Think about an interview like a conversation; this way you’ll look more comfortable and build rapport with your interviewer. 

## Question Flow

In general, you ask a question, the interviewer responds, and then you follow up. Depending on the interviewer’s response, you may follow up with a response like “that’s really helpful,” or if you have a follow up question to ask, now is an appropriate time to ask it. 

## What Kinds of Questions Should You Avoid

Anything related to vacation, working remotely, benefits, perks, review cycle, or work-life balance

- **Why?** Asking questions about these topics makes an employer question your motivations and think you only care about what’s in it for you.
- **A better way to ask**:Don’t ask any questions relating to these topics at any time during the interview process. When a job offer is on the table is the only time it’s appropriate (most of the above should be explained in an offer letter).

Questions about whether mentorship is offered at the company. 

- **Why?** Some companies have formal mentoring programs set up where employees are assigned a mentor, but not all do. If a company doesn’t mention mentoring first, don’t bring it up because the employer may not feel like they can give you the support you want (and thus conclude that you’re not a fit for the company). Additionally, candidates who focus on asking for mentorship are seen as less capable and required to be more closely supervised and less likely to contribute to a team.
- **A better way to ask:** “How do you approach onboarding employees?” ; “What is your feedback culture like at [Company]?” 

Compensation

- **Why?** Asking questions about compensation makes an employer question your motivations and think you only care about money.
- **A better way to ask:** Don't ask at any time. The employer should bring up the compensation. 

Employers want to hire people who are focused on contributing to a team specialized in what they do, and working with great people. Those should be your priorities when you’re asking questions. 

## Next Steps

Regardless of whether you're interviewing with them or whether it's a dream company, what's a company that you're interested in? Do your research and write three questions that you would ask at the end of an interview you would have with people from the company. Take time to review these questions with your coach for feedback.
